# STEP 1: Text Preprocessing Techniques

### 1. **Lowercasing**
   - Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity and reduce variations caused by case differences.

### 2. **Punctuation Handling**
   - Remove or handle punctuation marks to streamline text processing and focus on meaningful tokens.

### 3. **Stopword Removal**
   - Eliminate commonly used words (e.g., "and", "the") that do not add significant meaning to the text.

### 4. **Tokenization**
   - Split text into smaller units (tokens), such as words or sentences, to facilitate analysis.

### 5. **Stemming**
   - Reduce words to their root forms by removing suffixes (e.g., "running" → "run").

### 6. **Lemmatization**
   - Convert words to their base or dictionary form using context (e.g., "better" → "good").

### 7. **URL Removal**
   - Strip out URLs to prevent irrelevant data from affecting analysis.

### 8. **HTML Tag Removal**
   - Remove HTML tags to clean text extracted from web pages.

### 9. **Emoji Handling**
   - Replace or remove emojis to standardize textual representation.

### 10. **Chat Shortform Handling**
   - Expand common abbreviations and shortforms used in chats (e.g., "EOD" → "End OF Day", "ASAP" → "As Soon As Possible").

### 11. **Incorrect Text Handling**
   - Identify and correct spelling errors or typos to enhance text quality.
